Phu Nguyen,"Associate Adjunct Professor, Civil and Environmental Engineering",ndphu@uci.edu,"Profile Phu Nguyen is an Associate Adjunct Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Irvine. He received a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering (2003) from Bach Khoa University HCMC Vietnam and a Master's degree in Engineering Science (2008) from the University of Melbourne. He earned his Ph.D. degree in Civil Engineering from UC Irvine (2014). Nguyen’s research focuses on flood modeling and forecasting, and development of various global precipitation products observed by satellites including: event-based large scale rainfall systems using object-oriented approaches ( CONNECT ); integrated system for satellite precipitation and information ( RainSphere ); real-time high-resolution satellite and crowdsourced rainfall observations for hydrologic and natural disaster management applications ( iRain ), and on-demand data processing system for CHRS’s satellite precipitation products ( DataPortal ). Nguyen is currently doing research for the Center for Hydrometeorology & Remote Sensing (CHRS), Henry Samueli School of Engineering, UC Irvine.","Research Hydrology, GIS, satellite precipitation estimation algorithms, databases and visualization tools for remotely-sensed data and information, crowdsourcing, water resources systems",5300 Engineering Hall,(949) 824-3865,https://engineering.uci.edu/users/phu-nguyen
