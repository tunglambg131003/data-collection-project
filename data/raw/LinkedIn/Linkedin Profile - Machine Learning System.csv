Na Le Dang,M.D. Ph.D. | ML Researcher,"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a serious problem with increasing morbidity, mortality, and health care costs worldwide. In the U.S., ADRs are the fourth most common cause of death, costing 100,000 lives annually, and are responsible for more than 50% of acute liver failure cases and 280,000 hospital admissions. Idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions (IADRs) are hypersensitivity-driven ADRs. IADRs are the leading cause of drug clinical trial termination and drug withdrawal from the market. However, the majority of drugs in circulation are not associated with IADRs, so having reliable predictors to assess the IADR-risk of new drug candidates would allow us to avoid these adverse reactions. IADRs are caused by electrophilically reactive metabolites produced during drug metabolism. These reactive metabolites covalently attach to proteins and DNA to become antigenic and provoke toxic immune response. Unfortunately, current experimental and computational approaches, due to inadequate modeling of metabolism, do not reliably identify drug candidates that form reactive metabolites. The focus of my research is to model how reactive metabolites are formed through various metabolic transformations using machine learning and literature derived data. The research is innovative because it explicitly models how metabolism and reactivity, together, give rise to covalent adducts as precursors for IADRs. This approach will substantially improve on the existing experimental and computational approaches by more accurately modeling the properties determining whether metabolism renders drugs toxic or safe.",,Washington University School of Medicine,Jun 2013 - Present · 11 yrs 4 mos,https://www.linkedin.com/company/4607/,Science Computing Informatics Center (SCIC) tutor,"MD-PhD, Medicine",Washington University in St. Louis,https://www.linkedin.com/company/4608/,,English,Vietnamese,,"St Louis, Missouri, United States",,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/na-le-dang-washu/

Han Hoang,DevOps | Data Science & Machine Learning Student,"I am an open and curious individual with a diverse background in the field of scientific computation and system design. I still remember the joy that I experienced when a 7-year-old me was designing and building a playground to play with on my bored days in the weekend, or the euphoria that I had when finishing a Lego Castle set on my house roof under the bright night sky. That deep sense of joy in engineering parts into a magnificent architecture gives rise to my motivation to pursue a career as a solutions architect. Now I'm in the process of completing the University of California San Diego Data Science bachelor degree and Cisco Certified Network Associate program to further my competence not only in system design and architecture but also in using critical thinking for quantitative research and creative problem solving—the skills that I think are crucial to have as an IT architect. It is my desire to always be in the learning and practice of how to create higher quality solutions that will help businesses accomplish their goals in making the world a better place.",,Aquillius · Internship,Jun 2024 - Aug 2024 · 3 mos,https://www.linkedin.com/company/74369284/,Network and System Administrator,"B.S.
