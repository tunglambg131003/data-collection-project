Yours truly. 


hello!

				I was a postdoctoral associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology mentored by Professor Daniel Sanchez. I received my PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT in May 2022.
I focus on accelerating applications that haven't been adequately served by conventional computer architectures. In particular, my dissertation research has shown that irregular applications (those with data-dependent memory accesses, unpredictable branches) can be efficiently accelerated through fine-grain pipeline parallelism. There, I explored solutions from the core microarchitecture level to specialized spatial architectures.
In what time remains I develop a place-and-route tool for Minecraft circuits, maintain (and ride) vintage Schwinn bicycles, shoot film, and dance the Lindy Hop.

You can go for a drive. Caution: not useful.
In 2021, 2022, and 2023, I helped run SIGTBD, MIT CSAIL's joke conference.
In the summer of 2022, I bicycled across America ðŸš´ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
In May 2022, I defended my Ph.D. thesis and submitted my dissertation?!
You can tell the time. Caution: not useful.
