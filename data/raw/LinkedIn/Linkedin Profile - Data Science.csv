Kathleen N. Dang,Data Science Consultant at Guidehouse,"After immigrating to America at a young age, I took on the role of being my parents’ personal translator, bridging the gap between them and teachers, billing representatives, doctors, etc. As a data scientist, I strive to bridge the gap between data professionals and nontechnical audiences, empowering all to experience and understand data's significance regardless of language barriers and academic knowledge.Following my undergraduate years, I began my master’s in biostatistics and quickly realized my curiosity for data analysis applications rather than statistical theory. Luckily, during my one semester, I took a data science basics class that exposed me to R’s tidyverse and dplyr for data manipulation and visualization. For my final project, I created an aesthetic data narrative detailing a year’s worth of my streaming activity, a small-scale version of the data collection and storytelling that a company like Spotify attains annually. This experience introduced me to hands-on work with data, propelling me to pursue my master’s in analytics instead. I hope to expand beyond my public health background and employ my coding abilities with open-source languages, such as Python and R, to tackle big data and implement novel projects that cater to and enhance user experience, like Spotify Wrapped.When I’m not curating data and generating pretty graphs, you can find me working on my latest puzzle, reading on the curb outside my house, or curating playlists for every mood and occasion. Similar to data, music, which can be universally enjoyed, is much better when organized and presented for a specific purpose or audience.",,Guidehouse,https://www.linkedin.com/company/28974109/,Data Science Consultant,"Master of Science, Analytics",Institute for Advanced Analytics,https://www.linkedin.com/company/15238623/,,English,Spanish,,Washington DC-Baltimore Area,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kathleen-dang/
