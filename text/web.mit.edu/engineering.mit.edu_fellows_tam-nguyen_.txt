Tam  Nguyen
Tam is a PhD student in chemical engineering whose research applies systems engineering to solving problems in pharmaceutical manufacturing, with a focus on continuous processes for their potential to decrease costs and increase flexibility. She has constructed a novel kinetic model, written entirely with MATLAB code, for the manufacturing of the most important class of gene therapy products via triple transfection of mammalian cells. She has designed optimal model-based experiments necessary to estimate the model parameters, and she is using the model to design an optimal operating configuration for viral vector production in a bioreactor. Her goal is to build a complete and controlled continuous platform for gene therapy manufacturing. Tam earned a BS in chemical engineering from University ofMassachusetts at Amherst.
